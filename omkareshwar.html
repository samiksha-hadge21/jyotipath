        About Place:</h1>
        <h3>It is situated in the Mandhata city (also known as Omkareshwar) in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh state in India. It is about 16 km from Barwaha in Madhya Pradesh. Omkareshwar is formed by the sacred river Narmada. This is one of the most sacred rivers in India and is now home to one of the world's largest solar power plant. The temple is situated on Mandhata or Shivpuri island on the banks of Narmada and Kaveri river (a tributary of Narmada). The island is 4 KM long and 2.6 km2 (2,600,000 m2) in area and can be approached by boats and bridge. </h3>
      <br>
      <h1>History: </h1>
      <h3>The temple is said to have been built by the Paramara Kings of Malwa in the 11th century CE. After the Paramara kings, the administration of the temple was taken over by the Chauhan rulers. In the 13th century CE, the temple suffered destruction and loot by Muslim invaders starting with Mahmud Ghazni. Nevertheless, the temple remained intact without complete destruction. The temple was under the Chauhan Kings during the entire Mughal rule, without much renovation. In the 19th century, the temple was rebuilt by the Holkar rulers. The construction of the same was started by the 1st Holkar Queen,Gautama Bai Holkar and later completed by her daughter-in-law Devi Ahilyabai Holkar. The temple came under the British rule during the colonial era. After Independence in 1947, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) took over the responsibility of the temple with the help of the Khandwa administration. According to the Shiva Purana, once, Brahma and Vishnu had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he had discovered the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies, while Vishnu would be worshipped until the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga shrines are believed to be those places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. Originally, there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas of which 12 of them are considered to be the holiest.</h3>
