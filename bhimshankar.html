        About Place:</h1>
        <h3>Bhimashankar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva situated in its eponymous village, Bhimashankar, in Pune district of Maharashtra. It is a key pilgrimage centre and contains one of the 12 Jyotirlingas.Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga, located in the Sahyadri hills of Maharashtra, is a revered pilgrimage site and one of the 12 Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva. Situated about 50 kilometers from Pune, this temple holds immense spiritual significance for devotees and attracts pilgrims year-round. </h3>
      <br>
      <h1>History: </h1>
      <h3>According to one such legend, in the Treta Yuga, Kumbhkaran (brother of the evil King Ravana in Ramayana) had a son named Bhima who wanted to take revenge for his father’s death at the hands of Lord Rama.

        Fueled by revenge, Bhima started penance in the worship of Lord Brahma, the creator god, and received a boon of extreme power from him. After receiving so much power, Bhima became even more arrogant. And he threatened the then king Kamarupehsvar to stop worshipping Lord Shiva.
        
        When the king denied, Bhima held him captive, but the king continued his worship even in prison and made a Shivlinga there. Blinded by power, Bhima tried to destroy the Shivlinga with his sword, but Lord Shiva appeared at the site and killed him to save the innocent king. After that, all Gods appeared there and requested Shiva to stay in the place as a Jyotirlinga, which came to be known as Bhimshankar Jyotirlinga.
        
        Another legend goes that a demon called Tripurasura had started harassing innocent people after receiving a boon of immortality from Shiva. To kill the demon, Shiva asked Paravati, his wife, to help him, and together in the form of Ardhanarishvara, they killed the demon and restored peace on the land. In the memory of this incident, this shrine came into existence. </h3>

        <h1> Best Time To Visit</h1>
        <h3>
            November to February are the best months to visit Bhimashankar. Though the temple can be visited anytime of the year, trekkers can visit during winters if they are first time climbers as the climb can be tough during the monsoons because of the slopes being slippery. However, experienced trekkers will find trekking in monsoon quite pleasing because of its challenging nature and the chill weather </h3>
